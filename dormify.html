                small spaces while still helping them make their spaces aesthetically pleasing. For this 4-week project
                we were tasked with intervening in a problem area by constantly reframing of a problem statement. From
                this resulted a solution that we believed ultimately meets the need
                of the users. </ </div>

        <p class="c1">To begin our research we conducted an interview and survey with over 70 participant. For our
            survey, we were interested in knowing how and what resources students used in decorating their room and if
            the space constraints of the dorm room did pose a problem in doing this. From the result, we founf out that
            63% of students do want a particular and feel to their room, but knowing where to start can be an issue and
            so we geban to ask ourselves - <b>How might we help students plan and decorate their spaces in a way that
                suits them</b></p>

        <p class="c1">Trying to frame the problem posed as a big issue and knowing where a possible design intervention
            could be implemented. At first the solution felt appropriate but there was a challenge measuring the success
            of it as we couldn't successfully recruit people to test the feature we had created</p>

        <p class="c1">This was the first UX project I had ever done. I remember feeling excited, but I also remember
            feeling nervous. At the beginning, the concept of framing was something I found hard to grasp but through
            constant practice, and a lot of HMW questions I think I was able to catch on. I also had a great time with
            my team too. Team work was something I never really enjoyed prior to this project, but my teammates allowed
            be to understand that with the right team it can be an amazing experience where you gain together, achieve
            together, overcome little milestones and huge ones. I also realized that it’s the process that really
            matters, and it was a process I truly enjoyed.</p>

                art
                direction we decided to leverage the foreground and background direction. Implementing this, we used a
                faded colored text for as the static background and a brownish colored text as the forground which when
                scrolled is on top of the background. Before we got to thsi point, we did a considerably number of image
                grouping to get a clear sense of our direction.</p>

            process of making a
            decision, being confident in my ideas, font choices to name a few. I found that I restricted myself in doing
            a lot of things that I thought would improve the site because it was a "conference" but I learnt that while
            the site looks good and okay there a definetly much more creative and innovative ways to push it further</p>

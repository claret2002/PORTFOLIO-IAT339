        <p class="c1">The process of creating this website was very lateral. We conducted a bunch of image grouping as to the direction we would like to go in and ultimately decided on one: foreground and background. To implement this we used light, static color as the background text and a dark color as the forground text which when scrolled places the latter on top of the former to create depth</b></p>

        </div>
        <p class="c1">The process overall was a good one, but the most challenging part was the decidion making and being confident in what we were doing. Everyone had dfferent taste and things they wanted to, but ultimately we new we wanted to created something more simplified as opposed to the website of the previpus website. After a much sketches, image grouping and feedback we finally arrived at a common ground</p>

        </div>
        <p class="c1">There are a lot of things looking back that I would do different such as the process of making a decision, being confident in my ideas, font choices to name a few. I found that I restricted myself in doing a lot of things that I thought would improve the site because it was a "conference" but I learnt that while the site looks good and okay there a definetly much more creative and innovative ways to push it further</p>

            excited, but I
            also remember
            feeling nervous. At the beginning, the concept of framing was something I found hard to grasp but through
            constant practice, and a lot of HMW questions I think I was able to catch on. I also had a great time with
            my team too. Team work was something I never really enjoyed prior to this project, but my teammates allowed
            be to understand that with the right team it can be an amazing experience where you gain together, achieve
            together, overcome little milestones and huge ones. I also realized that it’s the process that really
            matters, and it was a process I truly enjoyed.</p>
